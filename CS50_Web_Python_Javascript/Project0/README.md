# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project0 is a simple personal website with the use of only html, css, scss and bootstrap.
The website includes 5 pages:
1. index.html: the page includes a navbar, an image of myself, a short description about me, and a footer.
2. about.html: similar to index.html, here you can find my personal image and a lipsum paragraph (I will describe about myself in the near future along with the CS50-web course)
3. Portfolio.html: with an image only. In the near future, I will add here a catalogue of my projects and promote my self (in this moment, I want to go further to learn in the course)
4. Resume.html: includes a table that lists some of my obtained certificates
5. contact.html: includes a contact form where visiters can send me a message for their inquiry. The form contains 4 fields: First name, last name, email, and message. Visiter can send their message by clicking the submit button.

Beside, the project0 also contains an image folder, a styles.css and a styles.scss
The website will be developed along the course
