Dear All,

This is a small website I made in the CS50-2020.
This website I made within few hours, because a new and full-functional version of this website will be released soon in the near future when I finish a web development course from HarvardX.
Sorry if you think it is not pretty to you. For me, I love and appreciate it.

Best regard,
Hong Hai Nguyen
