/*
John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.

To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).

(NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

// create a bill array
var bills = [124, 48, 268];

// create function to calculate tips
var calTip = function(bill) {
    var percentage = bill < 50 ? 20 : (bill >= 50 && bill <= 200) ? 15 : 10;
    return bill * percentage/100;
}

// an array contains all tips 
allTips = [calTip(bills[0]), calTip(bills[1]), calTip(bills[2])];
// an array contains all final paid amounts
finalAmounts = [allTips[0] + bills[0], allTips[1] + bills[1], allTips[2] + bills[2]];

console.log(allTips, finalAmounts);
