We need to customize the build process like this
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support#customizing-the-build-process
1. We need to add the following script in scripts of package.json file of server folder
"heroku-postbuild": "NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false npm install --prefix client && npm run build --prefix client"
2. git add . commit -> git push heroku master
- if error, delete package-log.json files in both client and server sides

or:
1) delete any ".git" folders you may have

2) rerun "git init" in terminal

3) "git status" -- will return everything in your directory

4) "git add ." -- to readd everything back

5) `git commit -m "some commit info" `

6) IMPORTANT! -- "git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/{your-repo-prefix}.git"

7) "git push --force heroku master" ---You will likely fail to push if you don't force it, as the contents of your repo no longer contain the exact contents of the remote repo


*** If still not possible, go to package.json file. make sure "node": 10x version:
"engines": {
    "node": "10.15.3",
    "npm": "6.4.1"
  }

*****************
if google or stripe key does not work after the deployment, make sure to remove the .env.production file from gitignore file (client)
